# KD-Tree Example

Implementation from the book [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://www.pbrt.org/), under [4.5 KD-Tree Accelerator](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1rcaYPZu9u8C&lpg=PA183&pg=PA227#v=onepage&q&f=false).

The algorithm is designed to take 3D axis aligned bounding boxes.

[Live example](http://andrewhills.github.io/kdtree/circles.html).
